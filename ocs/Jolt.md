# BACKSTORY
`
"Oh! I'm an open book! I think..."
`
## Early Backstory
`
Born to a masculine Sylveon and a modest Vaporeon, he was raised... Normally. No grand trauma at a young age, and while he did get bullied--he took a Friskian-method to dealing with his bullies. Disarmed by his unbridled kindness, he'd slowly start building up his negative emotions over time--hidden by his kind wholesome exterior, even to his closest.
`
## Recent Past
`
Growing weary from being constantly kind, he would join a band with Kuro and Danny--this would lay out his favorite method to let the emotions escape him. Screaming it out onto a mic, with two others, while slamming his fingers on a keyboard with precision. It was the cheapest therapy for him, and it worked like a charm.
`
## Current Situation
`
Living at home with his family, ready to leave high school and into college, still having no clue what he really wants to do in life.
